Welcome to Penrose's Garden!

This is the final project for my second year game development course. Along with my two groupmates, this project has been in development since late January 2024. 

Penrose's Garden is a relaxing puzzle game based on the idea of aperiodic tilings. In it, you play as a little bumblebee who has been tasked with building a garden out of Robinson tiles, a famous square aperiodic tiling of the plane.
